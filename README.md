## Use Cases and Features

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Co-Processing** | Augment MCU with additional processing power - including direct access to the MCU's hardware resources |
| **Stealth Control**      | Control devices without physical access to the target device or the MCU's knowledge |
| **Remote Telemetry**     | Transmit flash, RAM and peripheral data from device over WiFi |
| **Live Re-programming**  | Program devices while they are running, over WiFi |
| **Wireless Debugging**   | Debug devices over WiFi - no physical access required |

## Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default firmware** | Access ARM MCU's RAM/flash/peripherals via web/REST/binary interfaces over WiFi |
| **Custom firmware** | Quickly develop custom apps using Airfrog libraries and [examples](examples/README.md) |
| **Super-fast boot** | Airfrog transmits data from the target device within 5 seconds of power on |
| **Existing tooling integration** | Compatible with [probe-rs](https://probe.rs/) for programming and debugging. |
| **STM32 support** | Tested and works with STM32F4 ARM targets. |
| **Highly controllable** | Erase/reflash firmware while target is running, halt/reset target, read/write RAM/flash/peripherals |

## Quick Start

To install the default Airfrog firmware:

1. Install the [dependencies](BUILD.md#dependencies)

2. Connect the [Airfrog](pcb/README.md) via USB serial

3. Build and flash the [default firmware](airfrog/README.md)
    ```bash
    AF_STA_SSID=your-ssid AF_STA_PASSWORD=your-password cargo run --release -p airfrog
    ```

4. Point a browser to `http://airfrog-ip/` (IP from DHCP) to access the web interface

## Example Use Case - Remote Telemetry

Airfrog is used to add remote telemetry support to the [Software Defined Retro ROM (SDRR) ](https://piers.rocks/u/sdrr) which is based on the STM32F4 ARM MCU.

SDRR has no network interface or spare MCU cycles to transmit data, so Airfrog is installed.  It reads a counter directly from the MCU's RAM and sends it via MQTT over WiFi to be graphed on a remote system.

Airfrog can also be used to dynamically control SDRR during run-time, and reprogram it over WiFi.

This [demonstration](examples/mqtt.rs) was developed in 2-3 hours with
- 200 lines of Rust for the Airfrog firmware
- 90 lines of Python to produce the real-time graph.

![SDRR with Airfrog](docs/images/sdrr-mqtt.png)

If you are interested in precisely what is being shown here:
- Three SDRRs are installed in a Commodore 64, operating as Kernal, BASIC and Character ROMs repspectively.
- SDRR increments a counter in its RAM every time that ROM's chip select line(s) are asserted.
- Airfrog reads that counter directly from the MCU RAM every second.  It subtracts it from the previous value (to get a 1Hz sample rate) and sends it to an MQTT broker.
- The Python script subscribes to the appropriate MQTT topics and plots the data in real-time using `matplotlib`.
